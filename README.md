# Jenkins-Pipeline-CI-CD

**The idea is to have Jenkins setup, and can accomplish the following:**

- Create a github public repo 
- The repo should have a basic html code Link
- Any code changes pushed to Github repo should trigger a Jenkins job which should run html linter 
- In case the linter fails, the Jenkins job should fail, in case it passes, another Job should be triggered automatically that deploys the code using Apache Server.
